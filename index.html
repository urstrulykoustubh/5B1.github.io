                Decision intelligence is a new academic discipline concerned with all aspects of selecting between
                options. It brings together the best of applied data science, social science, and managerial science
                into a unified field that helps people use data to improve their lives, their businesses, and the world
                around them. It’s a vital science for the AI era, covering the skills needed to lead AI projects
                responsibly and design objectives, metrics, and safety-nets for automation at scale.

                <b> What’s a decision?</b><br>
                Data are beautiful, but it’s decisions that are important. It’s through our decisions — our actions —
                that we affect the world around us.
                We define the word “decision” to mean any selection between options by any entity, so the conversation
                is broader than MBA-style dilemmas (like whether to open a branch of your business in London).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> What’s a decision-maker?</b><br>
                In our parlance, a “decision-maker” is not that stakeholder or investor who swoops in to veto the
                machinations of the project team, but rather the person who is responsible for decision architecture and
                context framing. In other words, a creator of meticulously-phrased objectives as opposed to their
                destroyer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> What’s decision-making?</b><br>
                Decision-making is a word that is used differently by different disciplines, so it can refer to:
                taking an action when there were alternative options (in this sense it’s possible to talk about
                decision-making by a computer or a lizard).
                performing the function of a (human) decision-maker, part of which is taking responsibility for
                decisions. Even though a computer system can execute a decision, it will not be called a decision-maker
                because it does not bear responsibility for its outputs — that responsibility rests squarely on the
                shoulders of the humans who created it.

                Decision intelligence taxonomy
                One way to approach learning about decision intelligence is to break it along traditional lines into its
                quantitative aspects (largely overlapping with applied data science) and qualitative aspects (developed
                primarily by researchers in the social and managerial sciences).
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>What can you do with facts?</h3>
            1. You can use facts to make a single important pre-framed decision. If it’s important enough, you’ll need
            to lean heavily on the qualitative side of things to frame your decision wisely. Psychologists know that
            if you allow yourself to be ambushed by surprise information, it can manipulate you in ways you wouldn’t
            like, so they (and others) have lots to say about how to approach selecting the information you’ll
            accept in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. You can use facts to make a special kind of pre-framed decision, called an impact (or causal)
                decision.
                If your decision is framed in terms of taking an action to cause something to happen, then you need
                facts about cause-and-effect relationships to make your decision. In such cases, facts about effects
                (e.g. “people recover from this illness”) are useless to you if they don’t come with facts about causes
                (e.g. “because of antibiotics”). The way to get your hands on cause-and-effect information is to do a
                controlled experiment. On the other hand, if you are making an execution decision framed as a response
                to a non-causal fact (e.g. “if I have at least x in my savings account, I will treat myself to new
                shoes”), then an experiment is not necessary.

            </p>
            <p>
                3. You can use facts to make a single important existence-based decision. Existence-based decisions (“I
                just found out there exists a case of ebola right next door, so I’m getting out of here pronto…”) are
                decisions where the existence of a formerly unknown unknown shakes the foundation of your approach so
                much that you realize in hindsight that your decision context was sloppily framed.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. You can use facts to reveal an automation solution. By seeing the facts about the system, you can
                write
                code based on them. This is a better approach to traditional programming than coming up with the
                structure of a solution by thinking really hard with no information. For example, if you don’t know how
                to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, but you could use a dataset to look up the entry in Fahrenheit
                that goes with the Celsius input… but if you analyze that lookup table itself, you’ll discover the
                formula that connects them. Then you can just code up that formula (“model”) to do your dirty work for
                you and lose the clunky table.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. You can use facts sloppily to make unframed decisions. This is efficient when decisions have
                sufficiently low stakes that they do not warrant the effort required to approach them carefully, such
                as, “What should I eat for lunch today?” Attempting to be rigorous all the time on all decisions gives
                suboptimal long-run / lifetime outcomes and falls into the category of pointless perfectionism. Save
                your effort for the situations that are important enough for it, but please don’t forget that even if
                it’s efficient to use a low-quality low-effort approach, the optimal decision approach is still of low
                quality. You shouldn’t thump your chest or be overconfident when that’s your method… If you cut corners,
                you’re holding something flimsy. There are situations where flimsy gets the job done, but that doesn’t
                suddenly make your conclusion sturdy. Don’t lean on it. If you want high-quality decision-making, you
                need a more rigorous approach.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Quantitative side: Data science</h2>
            When you’ve framed your decision and you look up all the facts you need, using a search engine or an
            analyst (performing the role of a human search engine for you), all that’s left is to execute your
            decision. You’re done! No fancy data science needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                What if, after all that legwork and engineering jiu-jitsu, the facts delivered are not the facts you
                ideally need for your decision? What if they’re only partial facts? Perhaps you want tomorrow’s facts,
                but you only have the past to inform you. (It’s so annoying when we can’t remember the future.) Perhaps
                you want to know what all your potential users think of your product, but you can only ask a hundred of
                them. Then you’re dealing with uncertainty! What you know is not what you wish you knew. Enter data
                science!
